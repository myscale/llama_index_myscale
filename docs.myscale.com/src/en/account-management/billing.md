# Billing

This document provides instructions on managing the billing plan, modifying the payment method, and obtaining invoices for your account.

## Billing Method

For each cluster, billing is based on the usage time of pods, including their type, size, and replica. Invoices will be automatically generated at the beginning of the second month based on actual usage time.
